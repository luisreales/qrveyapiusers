            The idea is to develop an API that allows to store data from JSON and download those data
            as reports. Assuming you are building the backend for a Report application, Design and
            build an API that can serve all use-cases mentioned below. You donâ€™t need to build the UI
            for this application, j ust build the backend APIs for all the functionality the UI would need. If
            there i s some functionality that would be better i mplemented on the UI side, add a note i n
            your response why i t should be part of UI and not backend
